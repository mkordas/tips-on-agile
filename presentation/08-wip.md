## Work in Progress Limit

>Multitasking is the opportunity to screw up more than one thing at a time.
>>Unknown

WIP is maximum amount of work items a given phase or the whole workflow can
hold at once. These phases could be represented by a column or a cell on the
board.

WIP can be limited both for phase and for person.

## WIP Limit Choice

Too low WIP
* people not occupied in 100%, waste
* low productivity
* flow is slow

Just right WIP
* tasks are rarely idle
* people sometimes idle
* fastest flow

Too high WIP
* tasks not having enough attention
* people always busy
* low delivery time, low productivity
* lack of space on board...

#### Quotes on Multitasking

>Not everything matters equally, and success isn’t a game won by whoever does the most.
Yet that is exactly how most play it on a daily basis.
>>Gary Keller

>Multitasking is a lie
>>Gary Keller

>If you chase two rabbits, you will catch neither one.
>>Russian proverb

>When we think we’re multitasking we’re actually multiswitching.
That is what the brain is very good at doing – quickly diverting its attention
from one place to the next. We think we’re being productive. We are, indeed,
being busy. But in reality we’re simply giving ourselves extra work.
>>Michael Harris

>Multi-tasking is great in the kitchen when you are trying to time the chicken
to be ready at the same time as the potatoes. But do not assume it is a great
way to manage a workday.
>Joanne Tombrakos
