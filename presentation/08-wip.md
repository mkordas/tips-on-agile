## Work in Progress Limit

WIP is maximum amount of work items a given phase or the whole workflow can
hold at once. These phases could be represented by a column or a cell on the
board.

WIP can be limited both for phase and for person.

## WIP Limit Choice

Too low WIP
* people not occupied in 100%, waste
* low productivity
* flow is slow

Just right WIP
* tasks are rarely idle
* people sometimes idle
* fastest flow

Too high WIP
* tasks not having enough attention
* people always busy
* low delivery time, low productivity
* lack of space on board...
