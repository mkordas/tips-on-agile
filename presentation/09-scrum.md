Organization design cannot reduce these handoffs, but it can make them faster
and cheaper by making them occur inside a single team.

* Scrum Master helps the team to stay focused
* sprint finishes with demo, review and retrospective
* everything is shippable when tasks are done
* repeat until deadline or everything done or budget is present
