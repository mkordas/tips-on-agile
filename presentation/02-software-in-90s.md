# Software Projects in 1990s

Situation was pretty bad...
- Late projects
- Unhappy users
- Scope bloat
- Buggy code
- Demotivated developers

Cure?
- Plan your work, work your plan
- Plan-driven software process
- Many details about how software should be created
- Considered as future and professional approach
- Same as buildings are built
- Success = according to plan
- Very strong dependency to stable requirements

Approach to people
- have process designers
- find people, slot them in and tell what to do

Lightweight
- assume requirements are unstable
- change is inevitable
- software development is very complex discipline
  - cannot be easily visualized
  - huge amount of interactions and dependencies
- people are nonlinear, especially smart ones
  - problems and people are different
  - no strict roles
  - strengths and weaknesses

> A late change in requirements is a competitive advantage
