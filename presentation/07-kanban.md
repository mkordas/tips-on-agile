# Kanban

## Principles

Visualize work
* create model of your work on board
* make it visible for everyone
  * priorities
  * backlog
  * work in progress
  * blockers
  * bottlenecks
  * queues

Limit work in process
* strictly limit amount of "in progress" items
  * reduces time taken to deliver
  * less problems caused by tasks switching and reprioritizations

Focus on flow
* make flow smooth thanks to WIP
* collect metrics to analyze flow
* get indicators of future problems by analyzing the flow

Continuously improve
* experimenting and measuring effectiveness by tracking flow, quality,
  throughput, lead times
* culture of continuous improvement

>Kanban is not a software development lifecycle methodology or an approach
to project management. It requires that some process is already in place so that
Kanban can be applied to incrementally change the underlying process.
