## Principles

Visualize work
* create model of your work on board
* make it visible for everyone
  * priorities
  * backlog
  * work in progress
  * blockers
  * bottlenecks
  * queues

Limit work in process
* strictly limit amount of "in progress" items
  * reduces time taken to deliver
  * less problems caused by tasks switching and reprioritizations

Focus on flow
* make flow smooth thanks to WIP
* collect metrics to analyze flow
* get indicators of future problems by analyzing the flow

Continuously improve
* experimenting and measuring effectiveness by tracking flow, quality,
  throughput, lead times
* culture of continuous improvement
