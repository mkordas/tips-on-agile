1. Customer: sends the batch of coins to the workers, accepts (by touching) the
received coins from the last worker
2. Customer's Boss: Measures the time elapsed time between between sending out
the first coin and receiving:
 - the first coin accepted
 - all coins accepted
3. Workers: Each worker receives a batch of coins, flips them, and moves the
bath to the next worker
4. Efficiency experts: measure the time "their" worker spends flipping coins
