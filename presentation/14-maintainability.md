# Maintainability

### 10 to 1 Ratio

> Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1.
We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. 
Making it easy to read makes it easier to write.”
>> Robert C. Martin, Clean Code

### Psychopath

> Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent
psychopath who knows where you live. Code for readability.
>> John Woods
