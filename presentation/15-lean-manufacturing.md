## JIT

Just-in-time focuses to reduce flow and response times

Tools:

* make it right the first time – elimination of defects
* skill diversification – multi-functional workers
* preventive maintenance – flawless running, no defects
* skill diversification – multi-functional workers

## Autonomantion

Autonomation is automation with a human touch.
Full automation of everything would mean that all problems are detected and
corrected without any intervention. This usually is too expensive or impossible.

Human intervention should be needed only when alerted.
All repetitive work under normal conditions should be automated.
Thanks to that work becomes much more interesting.

1. Detect the abnormality.
2. Stop.
3. Fix or correct the immediate condition.
4. Investigate the root cause and install a countermeasure.

Last point is important. It's not only about fixing the defect,
but also evaluation and change of process to remove the possibility of making
the same mistake again.

## Poka-Yoke

Poka-yoke is "mistake-proofing" or “inadvertent error prevention”.
Sometimes referred as baka-yoke ("idiot-proof").

Examples:

* Clutch needs to be pressed before starting an engine (manual gearbox)
* Car in "park" or "neutral" before starting an engine (automatic gearbox)
* Brake pedal depressed when moving from "park" to "drive" (automatic gearbox)

Benefits:

* Less time spent on training workers.
* Elimination of many operations related to quality control.
* Unburdening of operators from repetitive operations.
* Promotion of the work improvement-oriented approach and actions.
* A reduced number of rejects.
* Immediate action when a problem occurs.
* 100% built-in quality control.

## Waste

### Muda

Meaning:
* uselessness
* wastefulness

#### Muda Type I

No value added for end customer, but it is necessary.

Known as **auxiliary work**.

Usually it is hard to eliminate. For example quality checks at car assembly line
do not provide direct value to customer, but they are required to fulfil
safety standards. What really matters to customer is just assembly process
itself.

#### Muda Type II

No value added for end customer which can and should be eliminated.
These activities bring hidden costs.

It is **pure waste**.

#### Elimination

Separate value-adding work from muda type I and II:
* very challenging
* "learning to see"
* waste may be identified where it was not seen before

### Muri

Meaning:
* overburden
* unreasonableness
* beyond someone's power

Causes:
* inappropriate process
* lack of training, equipment or tools
* mess
* poor communication channels
* unclear information, requirements or instructions

Avoidance:
* splitting work
* team expertise
* definition of done
* acceptance criteria

### Mura

"DOWNTIME" (Defective Production, Overproduction, Waiting, Non-used Employee Talent (the 8th form), Transportation, Inventory, Motion, and Excessive (Over) Processing)
