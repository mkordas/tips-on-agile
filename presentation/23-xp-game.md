# The Game

* Every Story is worth business value, but only if it is implemented fully
* Team with highest business value delivered wins
* Time is limited

## Estimates

* Ask questions about the stories
* Don't spend too much time, don't over-plan

## Iteration planning
* Prioritize stories by ROI
* How many stories per iteration?
  * Guess!

## Iteration
* Choose a time guardian
* Take the top priority story from the iteration plan (highest ROI)
* Team implements stories one by one
  * Time guardian starts timer when team starts to work and stops it when team
    is not working on anything
  * To work on story it needs to be moved from "todo" to "doing"
  * Team can work on one or two stories at once (max two items in "doing")
    * When team is working on any story time must be measured
  * Each story must be fully done and accepted by PO before it's moved to "done"
    * Acceptance time does not count into iteration time  
  * Repeat until out of time (180 sec)
  * If a story goes wrong, you may abandon it if agreed with PO
  
# After first iteration

Estimates vs. actual results
* Fixed iteration length (1 hourglass)
* By estimate we could do `E` effort points
* Actually we implemented `A` effort points

VELOCITY = `A` = effort points done per iteration

For your next iteration choose stories up to VELOCITY
